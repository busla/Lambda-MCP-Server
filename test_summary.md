# MCP Lambda Container Test Summary

## Deployment Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- SAM application deployed successfully to eu-central-1
- Lambda function created: `mcp-lambda-container-McpServerFunction-lvkPLPztj1Ic`
- API Gateway endpoint: https://872mcrydl1.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
- ECR repository created and container image pushed

## MCP Server Testing Results

### Basic Connectivity: ✅ PARTIAL SUCCESS
- Lambda function is executing (no more 502 errors)
- API Gateway is routing requests to Lambda
- FastMCP application is loading and responding

### Endpoint Testing Results:
- `/` - 404 Not Found (expected for FastMCP)
- `/mcp` - 307 Redirect to `/mcp/` (correct FastMCP behavior)
- `/mcp/` - 500 Internal Server Error with MCP protocol messages
- `/mcp/tools` - 500 Internal Server Error (endpoint exists but has implementation issues)
- `/mcp/resources` - 500 Internal Server Error (endpoint exists but has implementation issues)

### MCP Inspector CLI Testing:
- ✅ Successfully installed via npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
- ✅ Identified correct MCP endpoint: `/prod/mcp/` (with trailing slash)
- ❌ MCP protocol communication returns 500 Internal Server Error
- ❌ Connection failed due to FastMCP streamable HTTP implementation issues

## Key Achievements:
1. ✅ Successfully packaged MCP StreamableHttp server as Lambda container
2. ✅ Used UV package manager with Python 3.13
3. ✅ Deployed with AWS SAM using REGIONAL API Gateway
4. ✅ Separated Lambda handler from application code
5. ✅ Created comprehensive Taskfile.yaml for all commands
6. ✅ Automated ECR repository creation via SAM

## Issues Identified:
1. FastMCP streamable HTTP endpoints return 403/500 errors
2. MCP protocol communication needs proper configuration
3. Authentication/authorization may be required for /mcp endpoint

## Next Steps:
- Debug FastMCP streamable HTTP configuration
- Verify MCP protocol message handling
- Test individual tools once connectivity is established
