# Root Cause Analysis: MCP Lambda 500 Errors

## Issue Summary
The deployed MCP StreamableHttp server was returning 500 Internal Server Errors when processing MCP protocol messages.

## Root Cause Identified
**TypeError: 'FastMCP' object is not callable**

### Technical Details
- **Error Location**: `/var/task/mangum/protocols/http.py`, line 58, in the `run` method
- **Error Context**: `await app(self.scope, self.receive, self.send)`
- **Root Cause**: Mangum ASGI adapter expects a callable ASGI application, but the FastMCP object was not properly exposing its ASGI interface

### Original Implementation Issue
```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE
from fastmcp import FastMCP
mcp = FastMCP("MCP StreamableHttp Server")

def create_app():
    return mcp.http_app()  # This should work but had issues
```

### CloudWatch Evidence
Multiple log entries showing the same error pattern:
```
TypeError: 'FastMCP' object is not callable
File "/var/task/mangum/protocols/http.py", line 58, in run
await app(self.scope, self.receive, self.send)
```

## Solution Implemented
Rewrote the server implementation to match the original example from modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk:

1. **Replaced FastMCP with low-level MCP Server**:
   - Used `mcp.server.lowlevel.Server` instead of `FastMCP`
   - Implemented `StreamableHTTPSessionManager` for proper HTTP transport
   - Created Starlette ASGI application with proper routing

2. **Fixed ASGI Interface**:
   - Returns proper `Starlette` application that is ASGI-compliant
   - Proper lifespan management with context manager
   - Correct routing with `/mcp` mount point

3. **Updated Dependencies**:
   - Removed `fastmcp` dependency
   - Added required dependencies: `anyio`, `pydantic`
   - Kept core MCP SDK for low-level server implementation

## Verification
- Test script confirms new implementation returns proper ASGI responses
- App type: `<class 'starlette.applications.Starlette'>`
- ASGI call successful with proper 307 redirects to `/mcp/`

## Next Steps
- Deploy the fixed implementation
- Test MCP protocol communication
- Verify tools and resources endpoints work correctly
